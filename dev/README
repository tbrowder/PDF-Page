Font scaling in AFM files:

Every value in an AFM file has been
scaled by a scale factor (sf) to
be within the range [0..1000].

To get the actual value used in a document, the amount shown 
"should be multiplied by sf/1000."

Given a value x in the AFM coordinate system,
its actual value of X:

   X = x * (sf / 1000)

and 

   x = (X * 1000) / sf


So given a desired font size of F, sf is given by

   F = f * (sf / 1000)
   F / f = sf / 1000
   (F / f) * 1000 = sf

For example, use a font size, F, of 12.

   sf = (12 / 1000) * 1000 = 12

Another example, an x size of 600:
